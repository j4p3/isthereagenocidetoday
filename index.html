    <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
    <p>A Muslim ethnic group called the Uighur people live in a region called Xinjiang, which was conquered by China in the 1700s. In recent years, Uighur separatist groups have attacked people with knives elsewhere in China. Now the Chinese Party is attempting eliminate the Uighur people by kidnapping their leaders, kidnapping their children to ensure they don't speak their parents' language, and kidnapping any Uighur who objects. A massive surveillance network and thousands of concentration camps have been built to accomplish this. The situation is a Holocaust: graveyards of Uighurs are being paved over, detaniees' organs are being harvested, and the extent of the atrocity is being concealed from the Chinese people and from the world.</p>
